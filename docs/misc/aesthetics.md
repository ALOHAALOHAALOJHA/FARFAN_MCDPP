FARFAN Visual Protocol: Professional Aesthetic Extension Based on Sagasan/Orlan Surgical-Performative Theory

ELEVATED THEORETICAL FRAME 1.1 From Allegory to Anatomical Theatre Your current work operates allegorically—figures stand for concepts. To reach Sagasan/Orlan territory, shift from representation to presentation of transformation itself. Sagasan's principle: The face/body mid-collapse is not a metaphor for crisis—it IS the crisis made visible through material witness. Orlan's principle: Surgery is not about beauty/ugliness but about making the social contract with the body legible by literalizing its violence. For FARFAN: Your red→blue→green pipeline already has this kernel. Now make it forensic. Don't show "a figure in bureaucratic chaos"—show the moment bureaucracy inscribes itself onto flesh, the instant data becomes somatic.
1.2 Material Witnesses: Bodies as Data Substrates Sagasan: Uses clay, flour, paint on his own face to show how identity is built and destroyed in real-time. The medium IS the body. Orlan: Uses surgical modification and video documentation to show how medical/aesthetic systems operate on bodies as raw material. FARFAN Application:

Figures should bear literal marks of the pipeline phases: scars where forms were extracted, crystalline growths where data was embedded, burn patterns from failed validations. Texture becomes evidence: Instead of painterly brushwork suggesting emotion, use forensic texture—grid imprints on skin, barcode tattoos, document fragments embedded in flesh like shrapnel. Poses become procedures: Not "person reaching upward" but "person mid-transformation," caught in the act of being rewritten by system logic.

FORMAL OPERATIONS: BEYOND TRIPTYCH 2.1 Surgical Sequence Panels (Orlan Model) Replace narrative triptychs with procedure documentation: Structure: 5–9 panels in medical report layout:
Pre-operative state: Red, figure intact but marked for intervention (literal chalk lines, measurement grids on body). Incision/Decomposition: Figure partially disassembled—limbs separated into geometric components, torso opened to reveal internal graph structures. Mid-procedure crisis: Blue, maximum abstraction—body becomes pure system, organs replaced by algorithmic nodes. Re-assembly: Geometric parts reconnect but wrongly—Frankensteinian seams, mismatched proportions. Post-operative: Green, but uncanny—figure healed into new form that is functional but alien, networked but haunted.

Layout: Use clinical white gutters. Number panels like medical slides. Include "margin notes" in tiny sans-serif—technical jargon from your pipeline docs, but applied to bodies: "Subject 047: Ingestion Phase, 12min elapsed, chunk integrity 73%."

2.2 Sagasan Time-Collapse Panels Sagasan's performances are documented as time-lapse of decay and reconstruction—flour poured over face, then slowly cracking, then reformed. FARFAN Adaptation:

Single figure across 7–12 sequential panels, each showing micro-increments of transformation:

Panel 1: Human face, holding document. Panel 2–4: Document begins to dissolve into face—ink bleeds into skin, paper texture merges with flesh. Panel 5–8: Face fragments into data shards—geometry replaces organic curves. Panel 9–12: Reconstruction as networked entity—facial features return but made of filaments, nodes where eyes were.

Key: No dramatic "before/after." Only continuous becoming. Viewer must lean in and stare to see the change between frames—discomdashboard.html1,834 líneashtmlno. la idea es que extrapoles un lineamiento estetico para los graficos y todo el layout the read.me y documentación usando este analisis que ya permea nuestro dashboard:4 de dicFARFAN Visual Protocol: Extended Aesthetic Guidelines From Dashboard to Documentation Ecosystem

CORE VISUAL DNA: THE ATROZ COVENANT 1.1 Triadic Color System as Narrative Engine Your dashboard already operationalizes the red→blue→green pipeline at the UI level. Now extend this to all documentation artifacts: Red Band (Chaos/Input/Problem Space)
Primary: #C41E3A (atroz-red-500), #7A0F0F (atroz-red-700), #3A0E0E (atroz-red-900) Use for: Phase 0 validation failures, raw input states, error conditions, "before" states, burden visualization Texture: Organic, flame-like, swirling brush strokes Typography: Slightly compressed, high tracking (2-3px), uppercase for headers Backgrounds: Dark with hot gradients radiating from problem zones

Blue Band (Structure/Analysis/System)

Primary: #00D4FF (atroz-blue-electric), #102F56 (atroz-blue-700), #04101A (atroz-blue-900) Use for: Pipeline machinery, graph structures, chunking visualizations, orchestrator flows, architectural diagrams Texture: Geometric, faceted, crystalline, grid-based Typography: Monospace (JetBrains Mono), technical, lowercase for code, tabular data Backgrounds: Deep blue-black with planar divisions, tessellated grids

Green Band (Synthesis/Output/Solution)

Primary: #39FF14 (atroz-green-toxic), #BFEFCB (atroz-green-300), #0B231B (atroz-green-900) Use for: Validated outputs, knowledge graphs lit up, successful transformations, renewal states Texture: Neural filaments, branching networks, organic-over-geometric hybrids Typography: Same as blue but with green electric glow effects on key terms Backgrounds: Dark teal with luminous network overlays

Copper Band (Evidence/Provenance/Memory)

Primary: #B2642E (atroz-copper-500), #7B3F1D (atroz-copper-700), #17A589 (atroz-copper-oxide patina) Use for: Citations, provenance chains, evidence streams, archival references, oxidized/weathered system states Texture: Metallic sheen with oxidation patterns, ticker-tape data flows Typography: Small, condensed, italicized for citations, glowing scanlines for live data Backgrounds: Copper-to-teal gradients suggesting aged metal

1.2 Typography as Semantic Layer Hierarchical System: LEVEL 1 (Project/Book Titles):

Font: JetBrains Mono 200 weight
Size: 24-32px
Tracking: 8-12px
Case: UPPERCASE
Color: Gradient from ink (#E5E7EB) to green-toxic
Effect: Text-shadow glow, glitch animation on hover
Use: README headers, cover pages, dashboard titles
LEVEL 2 (Section/Phase Headers):

Font: JetBrains Mono 400 weight
Size: 16-20px
Tracking: 3-4px
Case: UPPERCASE
Color: Band-specific (red/blue/green based on content)
Effect: Subtle scanline animation behind text
Use: Chapter openers, phase documentation headers
LEVEL 3 (Subsection/Component Labels):

Font: JetBrains Mono 400 weight
Size: 11-14px
Tracking: 2px
Case: Title Case or lowercase
Color: Ink with 70% opacity
Effect: Copper underline on hover
Use: Function names, module headers, diagram labels
LEVEL 4 (Body/Technical Content):

Font: JetBrains Mono 400 weight
Size: 11-12px
Tracking: 0-1px

Tracking: 1-2px
Case: lowercase or SMALL CAPS
Color: Copper-500 with 50% opacity
Effect: Blink animation on active citations
Use: Source attributions, timestamps, provenance markers Never use fonts outside JetBrains Mono. The monospace uniformity reinforces the "code as law" philosophy and keeps visual noise minimal.

WRITING STYLE GUIDE 8.1 Voice & Tone Principles:
Forensic, not academic: Describe the system like a medical examiner describes a body—neutral, precise, evidence-based Active, not passive: "The pipeline ingests PDFs" not "PDFs are ingested" Present tense: "The orchestrator signals workers" not "will signal" Metaphor-rich but anchored: Use visceral metaphors but always tie back to technical reality

Example Transformation:

Before: "The system processes documents by extracting text and metadata." After: "The ingestion phase dissects each PDF—scalpel-precise text extraction, metadata lifted like fingerprints from the corpus."

8.2 Section Templates For Each Phase Documentation: markdown# [Phase Name]: [Visceral Metaphor]

Provenance Trail

[Copper-styled list of all evidence sources, contracts, tests that prove this phase works] 8.3 Code Comment Style In-line comments should match the aesthetic: typescript// ❌ BEFORE (generic) // Get the document chunks const chunks = await getChunks(docId);

AESTHETIC PHILOSOPHY SUMMARY The FARFAN/ATROZ visual system is:
Triadic → Every element maps to red (chaos), blue (system), or green (renewal) Forensic → UI elements feel like instruments in a clinical analysis Provenance-Obsessed → Copper threading throughout, every claim has a source Kinetic → Nothing is static; gradients pulse, connections flow, data breathes Monospace-Pure → JetBrains Mono everywhere, no exceptions, code == law Dark-First → #0A0A0A base, light emerges from dark, not vice versa Hexagonal → Primary geometric primitive, ties to PDET regional nodes Evidence-Streaming → Information flows like blood in capillaries, always visible at edges Deterministic → Every visual state is reproducible, no randomness in production Mechanistic → The aesthetic serves the pipeline; beauty follows function
