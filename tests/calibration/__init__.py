"""
Comprehensive Test Suite for F.A.R.F.A.N Calibration System

This test suite validates the complete calibration system including:
- All calibration layers (@b, @chain, @q, @d, @p, @C, @u, @m)
- Choquet aggregation with interaction terms
- Property-based validation (boundedness, monotonicity, normalization)
- Integration tests for full calibration flow
- Performance benchmarks

Target: 100% coverage of calibration system
