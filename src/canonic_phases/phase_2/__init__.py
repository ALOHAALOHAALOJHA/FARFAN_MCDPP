Phase 2: Contract Enforcement Layer

Canonical implementation of the executor orchestration phase.
Transforms Canonical Policy Packages (CPP) into evidence-rich analytical outputs
using 300 specialized executor contracts.
This module contains contract enforcement mechanisms for Phase 2 of the
F.A.R.F.A.N pipeline, implementing DURA LEX (strict law) enforcement principles.

Submodules:

from __future__ import annotations

Entry Point:
    execute_phase_2: Main orchestration function

Invariants:
    - Exactly 300 executor contracts (Q001-Q300)
    - Deterministic execution with fixed random seed
    - Schema-validated contract compliance
    - No legacy artifact imports
