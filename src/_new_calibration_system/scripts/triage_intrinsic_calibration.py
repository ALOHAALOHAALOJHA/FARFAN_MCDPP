"""
Rigorous Intrinsic Calibration Triage - JOBFRONT 3

Applies decision automaton to EVERY method in canonical_method_catalog.json.
Uses machine-readable rubric from config/intrinsic_calibration_rubric.json.
Produces traceable, reproducible evidence for all scores.

Pass 1: Determine if method requires calibration (3-question gate)
Pass 2: Compute evidence-based intrinsic scores using explicit rubric rules
Pass 3: Populate intrinsic_calibration.json with reproducible evidence

NO UNIFORM DEFAULTS. Each method analyzed individually.
ALL SCORES TRACEABLE. Evidence shows exact computation path.

STUB - Full implementation will be added in JOBFRONT 3.
